## A project for Boğaziçi University's ME 331: Mechatronics class.

The project aims to automatically tune a guitar with DC motors by processing sound waves. The code is written in Arduino and does the following:

* Process the sound waves by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
* Automatically control the DC motors according to the desired tuning type.
* Manage the user interface which includes a push button and an LCD screen.

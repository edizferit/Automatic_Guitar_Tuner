# Automatic Guitar Tuner

A project for Boğaziçi University's **ME 331: Mechatronics** class.

The project aims to automatically tune a guitar with DC motors by processing sound waves. More information about the project can be found at the following link: https://edizferit.com/project/automatic-guitar-tuner/

The code is written in Arduino and performs the following operations:

* Analyze sound waves using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
* Control the DC motors to tune the guitar to the desired pitch.
* Manage the user interface, which includes a push button and an LCD screen.
